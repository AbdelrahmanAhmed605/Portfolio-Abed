# Abeds Portfolio

## Description

Abdelrahman Ahmed is a full-stack developer based in Vancouver, Canada. This project is a display of his portfolio which showcases his most notable projects to date. The portfolio allows viewers to examine his work and determine his level of skills based on the result as well as the source code used to deploy it. This project was designed using HTML & CSS as it was made in the early stages of his web development journey. As Abdelrahman continues to learn new skills and new languages, he will make continuous updates to this portfolio to better showcase his newfound skills. 

During the first draft of this portfolio, Abdelrahman learnt how to use css stylings such as flex displays and media queries to make the website more dynamic for users on mobile devices or a resized web browser.
